Introduction

UNIBI has developped a HTTP interface for SBCAT to support a more comfortable

access to the SBCAT functionality, especially for institutional activities

It is based on the SBCAT SRU interface and allows

    easy search syntax (supporting search form usage)
    Toolkit Templating including (using a down-sized metadata format)
    Sub-Templating for different institutional views
    Snippet generator

The script bup_sru.pl is based on CGI, is located in the sbcat cgi directory and has to

be activated in the Apache Server configuration (e.g. as script bup).

It uses the SBCAT SRU interface to search queries, analyses the MODS responses, transfers

that into a templating orientated variable structure, calls the CSL engine to produce

bibliographic citations and displays the results.

The internal functions are:

    display search mask
    search
    display front-page (single record)
    display publishing list (of authors, departments, projects)
    embed (display generator form)

To produce more efficient long publishing list (with thousands of entries) UNIBI

has developped an alternative strategy based on ORMSOO calls to the

SBCAT database and caching the template structure to speed the creation of these lists.
